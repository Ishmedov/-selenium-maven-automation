Steps to automate:
-Make sure you understand what functionality is being tested
and each step. What is expected, what is being tested.
If you don't understand: Ask manual tester/person who wrote it.
BAs, Developers, Lead
-Manually test it and make sure , it is passing manually.
And make sure no defects/bugs around it.
-if a test case is failing manually, it does not qualify
for automation.
